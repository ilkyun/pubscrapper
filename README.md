pubscrapper with golang

Using NCBI APIs, pubscrapper can get the list of papers with breif information such as title, impact factor, authors, publication date, and abstract.

Since it built on Golang, the installation of language (see https://golang.org) and deposition of clone in the $GOPATH are necessary to run.
