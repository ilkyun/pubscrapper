# pubscrapper

pubscrapper with golang

Using NCBI APIs, pubscrapper can get the list of papers with breif information such as title, impact factor, authors, publication date, and abstract.

To shutdown server, Press Ctrl+C (not command) on the terminal window.

# Update Apr.20.2020

PubScrapper (executable file) works fine without golang installation. I confirmed in MacOSX Catalina (10.15) and Mojave (10.14).

# Update Apr.02.2020

Since it built on Golang, the installation of language (see https://golang.org) and deposition of clone in the \$GOPATH are necessary to run .
