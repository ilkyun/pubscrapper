Multiscale modelling of drug transport and metabolism in liver spheroids.,Interface focus,3.179,2020 Apr 06," Leedale Joseph A, Kyffin Jonathan A, Harding Amy L, Colley Helen E, Murdoch Craig, Sharma Parveen, Williams Dominic P, Webb Steven D, Bearon Rachel N","In early preclinical drug development, potential candidates are tested in the laboratory using isolated cells. These in vitro experiments traditionally involve cells cultured in a two-dimensional monolayer environment. However, cells cultured in three-dimensional spheroid systems have been shown to more closely resemble the functionality and morphology of cells in vivo. While the increasing usage of hepatic spheroid cultures allows for more relevant experimentation in a more realistic biological environment, the underlying physical processes of drug transport, uptake and metabolism contributing to the spatial distribution of drugs in these spheroids remain poorly understood. The development of a multiscale mathematical modelling framework describing the spatio-temporal dynamics of drugs in multicellular environments enables mechanistic insight into the behaviour of these systems. Here, our analysis of cell membrane permeation and porosity throughout the spheroid reveals the impact of these properties on drug penetration, with maximal disparity between zonal metabolism rates occurring for drugs of intermediate lipophilicity. Our research shows how mathematical models can be used to simulate the activity and transport of drugs in hepatic spheroids and in principle any organoid, with the ultimate aim of better informing experimentalists on how to regulate dosing and culture conditions to more effectively optimize drug delivery."
Recent Advances in Practical Methods for Liver Cell Biology: A Short Overview.,International journal of molecular sciences,4.296,2020 Mar 16," Torres Sandra, Abdullah Zeinab, Brol Maximilian J, Hellerbrand Claus, Fernandez Mercedes, Fiorotto Romina, Klein Sabine, KÃ¶nigshofer Philipp, Liedtke Christian, Lotersztajn Sophie, Nevzorova Yulia A, Schierwagen Robert, Reiberger Thomas, Uschner Frank Erhard, Tacke Frank, Weiskirchen Ralf, Trebicka Jonel","Molecular and cellular research modalities for the study of liver pathologies have been tremendously improved over the recent decades. Advanced technologies offer novel opportunities to establish cell isolation techniques with excellent purity, paving the path for 2D and 3D microscopy and high-throughput assays (e.g., bulk or single-cell RNA sequencing). The use of stem cell and organoid research will help to decipher the pathophysiology of liver diseases and the interaction between various parenchymal and non-parenchymal liver cells. Furthermore, sophisticated animal models of liver disease allow for the in vivo assessment of fibrogenesis, portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and for the preclinical testing of therapeutic strategies. The purpose of this review is to portray in detail novel in vitro and in vivo methods for the study of liver cell biology that had been presented at the workshop of the 8th meeting of the European Club for Liver Cell Biology (ECLCB-8) in October of 2018 in Bonn, Germany."
